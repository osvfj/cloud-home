I created this project in order to learn more about the file system, how to manipulate files in Node.js, and to use it as a more privacy-friendly alternative to Google Drive. You can give a path for the server to create, edit, delete, rename, download, and more activities with the documents (photos, videos, pdf). It has an auth system and uses MongoDB as the data base. The client is not completly finished, but mostly functional.
